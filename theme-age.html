            <p>
                Think about how differently a child, a teenager, and a grandparent might see the same situation. That's what "Age as a Lens" is all about! Our TEDx salon explores how our view of life changes as we grow older. We'll hear fascinating stories from speakers of all ages - from amazing kids with unique talents to active seniors who redefine what it means to be "old."

                Whether you're 15 or 50, you'll discover how each stag  of life gives us a special way of seeing the world, and how understanding these different viewpoints can bring us all closer together.
